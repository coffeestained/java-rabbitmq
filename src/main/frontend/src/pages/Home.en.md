As with anything public & made by me on this GITHUB -- please feel free to utilize as you wish as long as you follow the license agreements of any dependencies used.

I don't need any attribution directly. The only thing I ask is that you take steps and efforts to help budding software developers in the world whenever you can in the form of mentoring and tutoring.

Many of us are direct descendants of actions such as those and it is important that we take efforts to pass that on as we build a more unified world.
